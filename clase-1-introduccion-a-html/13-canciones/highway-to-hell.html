    <h2>Letra:</h2>
    <p>Livin' easy
        Lovin' free
        Season ticket on a one way ride
        Askin' nothin'
        Leave me be
        Takin' everythin' in my stride
        Don't need reason
        Don't need rhyme
        Ain't nothin' that I'd rather do
        Goin' down
        Party time
        My friends are gonna be there too
        I'm on the highway to hell
        On the highway to hell
        Highway to hell
        I'm on the highway to hell
        No stop signs
        Speed limit
        Nobody's gonna slow me down
        Like a wheel
        Gonna spin it
        Nobody's gonna mess me around
        Hey satan
        Payin' my dues
        Playin' in a rockin' band
        Hey mumma
        Look at me
        I'm on the way to the promised land
        I'm on the highway to hell
        Highway to hell
        I'm on the highway to hell
        Highway to hell
        Don't stop me
        I'm on the highway to hell
        On the highway to hell
        Highway to hell
        I'm on the highway to hell
        (Highway to hell) I'm on the highway to hell
        (Highway to hell) highway to hell
        (Highway to hell) highway to hell
        (Highway to hell)
        And I'm goin' down
        All the way
        I'm on the highway to hell</p>
