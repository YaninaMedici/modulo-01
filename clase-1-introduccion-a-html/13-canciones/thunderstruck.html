    <h2>Letra:</h2>
    <p>Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder
        Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder
        Thunder, thunder
        I was caught
        In the middle of a railroad track (thunder)
        I looked 'round
        And I knew there was no turning back (thunder)
        My mind raced
        And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
        And I knew
        There was no help, no help from you (thunder)
        Sound of the drums
        Beating in my heart
        The thunder of guns
        Tore me apart
        You've been
        Thunderstruck
        Rode down the highway
        Broke the limit, we hit the town
        Went through to Texas, yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
        We met some girls
        Some dancers who gave a good time
        Broke all the rules
        Played all the fools
        Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds
        And I was shaking at the knees
        Could I come again, please?
        Yeah, them ladies were too kind
        You've been
        Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
        Ooh, thunderstruck, yeah
        I was shaking at the knees
        Could I come again, please? Oh
        Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, said, yeah, it's alright, we're doin' fine
        Yeah, it's alright, we're doin' fine, fine, fine
        Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
        Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
        Thunderstruck, whoa, baby, baby
        Thunderstruck, you've been thunderstruck
        Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
        Thunderstruck, you've been thunderstruck</p>
